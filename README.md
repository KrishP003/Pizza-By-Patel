The RU Pizza Order Management System is a comprehensive software developed in JavaFX to facilitate the efficient management of pizza orders for RU Pizza. The project requires the implementation of a user-friendly graphical interface with functionalities for ordering specialty pizzas, customizing pizzas with a "build your own" option, reviewing and placing orders, browsing current orders, and managing store-wide orders. The system incorporates detailed pricing logic based on pizza types, sizes, toppings, and additional options such as extra sauce and cheese. To maintain code quality, the project follows a specified coding standard, enforces the Factory Method pattern for pizza creation, and mandates the creation of JUnit tests for the BuildYourOwn class. Furthermore, the project includes the generation of Javadoc documentation and a class diagram to ensure clarity and adherence to design principles. The emphasis on GUI development, proper exception handling, and thorough system testing underscores the commitment to delivering a robust and user-friendly pizza order management solution.
